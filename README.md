# WuffChat - AI Dog Behavior Assistant

> **Current Status**: Stable V2 in production | V3 agentic architecture in development

WuffChat helps dog owners understand their pets' behavior through AI-powered conversations. The system provides behavioral insights from the dog's perspective, explaining actions through canine instincts and psychology.

## Vision: Digital Twin of Your Dog

We're building an autonomous AI agent that serves as a digital twin of a dog - allowing humans to communicate in natural language while learning about dog behavior, needs, and their unique way of experiencing the world.

**Current Production (V2)**: FSM-based conversation flow with GPT-4 integration  
**In Development (V3)**: BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) autonomous agent architecture
